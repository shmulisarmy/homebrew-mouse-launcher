# Mouse Launcher - Homebrew Packaging Summary

## What's Been Set Up

I've prepared your `mouse_launcher` project for Homebrew installation. Here's what has been created:

### üìÅ New Files Created

1. **`README.md`** - Project documentation with installation instructions
2. **`LICENSE`** - MIT license for the project
3. **`Formula/mouse-launcher.rb`** - Homebrew formula for installation
4. **`.github/workflows/release.yml`** - GitHub Actions workflow for automated releases
5. **`scripts/release.sh`** - Script to automate the release process
6. **`HOMEBREW_SETUP.md`** - Detailed guide for setting up the Homebrew tap
7. **`Makefile`** - Build automation
8. **`.gitignore`** - Git ignore rules

### üîß Code Changes Made

1. **Added version flag** to `main.go` - Users can now run `mouse_launcher --version`
2. **Updated main function** to handle command-line flags
3. **Added version constant** for easy version management

### üöÄ Next Steps to Complete Setup

1. **Create GitHub Repository**
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   git branch -M main
   git remote add origin https://github.com/shmulisarmy/mouse-launcher.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

2. **Create Homebrew Tap Repository**
   - Create a new GitHub repository named `homebrew-mouse-launcher`
   - Copy `Formula/mouse-launcher.rb` to this repository
   - Update the GitHub username in the formula

3. **Create First Release**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/release.sh 1.0.0
   ```

4. **Update Formula SHA256**
   - After the release is created, download the binary and calculate SHA256
   - Update the formula with the correct hash

5. **Test Installation**
   ```bash
   brew tap YOUR_USERNAME/mouse-launcher
   brew install mouse-launcher
   ```

### üìã Files Overview

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `Formula/mouse-launcher.rb` | Homebrew formula for installation |
| `.github/workflows/release.yml` | Automated builds and releases |
| `scripts/release.sh` | Release automation script |
| `HOMEBREW_SETUP.md` | Complete setup guide |
| `Makefile` | Build and release commands |

### üéØ Final Result

Once completed, users will be able to install your tool with:
```bash
brew install shmulisarmy/mouse-launcher/mouse-launcher
```

### üîç Important Notes

- The build process may require specific Go dependencies that work on macOS
- The existing `mouse_launcher` binary in your project can be used for the first release
- Make sure to test the formula locally before making it public
- Update the version numbers in both `main.go` and the formula for each release
